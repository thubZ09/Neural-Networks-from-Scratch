##Custom Neural Network Implementation

Developing a basic Neural Network with an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset. This will be achieved using only NumPy, avoiding any machine learning libraries.

Objective: To gain a comprehensive understanding of the internal workings of a neural network by constructing it step by step.
