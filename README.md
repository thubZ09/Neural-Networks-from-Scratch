# Neural-Network-from-Scratch
Building a simple Neural Network with an input layer, two hidden layers, and one output layer to classify the images of Fashion-MNIST dataset, without using any ML library - only NumPy.

Aim: to understand in detail what happens inside a neural network while building it from scratch.
